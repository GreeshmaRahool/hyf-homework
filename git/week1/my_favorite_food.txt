Ingredients
2 packages (13 oz. each) of Celentano Gluten-Free Ravioli
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and diced
2 red bell peppers, diced
2 cups fresh corn
1 chipotle chili, minced
1 tablespoon cumin
1 tablespoon chili powder
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon each salt and ground black pepper
1-1/2 cups canned black beans, drained and rinsed
1 lime, juiced
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped (and more for garnishing)
1-1/2 cups sharp cheddar cheese

Cooking Directions
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the ravioli according
to the package directions. Drain and set aside when complete.
Preheat your oven broiler. In a large skillet heat the olive oil over
medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté until soft and
caramelized (about 5 minutes). Add the jalapeño pepper, red
pepper and corn. Sauté for 5 minutes and then add the chipotle
chili, cumin, chili powder, oregano, cayenne, salt and black pepper.
Stir in the black beans and sauté for another 3-5 minutes or until
the vegetables are soft. Add the ravioli to the skillet. Turn off the
heat and toss well. Add the chopped cilantro and lime juice and
toss again. Make sure everything is in an even layer and then spread
the cheese all over the dish. Place the whole skillet into the broiler
or transfer to an oven safe dish. Broil for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Remove and top with your favorite toppings.
